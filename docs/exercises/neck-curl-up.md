# Neck Curl Up

## Overview
- **Category**: Jawline & Neck
- **Target Areas**: Platysma, Sternocleidomastoid, Digastric muscles, Suprahyoid muscles
- **Equipment Needed**: Yoga mat or soft surface (optional towel for neck support)

## How It Works
The neck curl up is similar to an abdominal crunch but for the neck muscles. By lying on your back and lifting your head off the ground using your neck muscles, this exercise directly targets the platysma and other anterior neck muscles. This strengthens the muscles that support the jawline and can help reduce the appearance of a double chin by toning the area beneath the jaw.

## Instructions

### Step-by-Step (All Levels)
1. **Starting position**: Lie on your back on a mat, knees bent, feet flat on the floor
2. **Place your hands flat** on the floor beside you for stability (not behind head)
3. **Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth** firmly
4. **Lift your head slightly** off the floor by engaging your neck muscles (not your abs)
5. **Tuck your chin** toward your chest as you lift
6. **Hold for 3-5 seconds** at the top
7. **Lower slowly** back to the starting position with control

### Beginner Variation
- **Duration per session**: 5-8 repetitions
- **Frequency**: 3 times per week
- **Intensity**: Small lifts, focus on muscle engagement over range
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Place a small rolled towel under neck for support
  - Lift head only 1-2 inches off the floor
  - Hold for only 2-3 seconds
  - Can place one hand gently on forehead for slight assistance
  - Focus on feeling the front neck muscles working

### Intermediate Variation
- **Duration per session**: 10-12 repetitions, 2 sets
- **Frequency**: 4-5 times per week
- **Intensity**: Moderate lift with full muscle engagement
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Lift head 3-4 inches off the floor
  - Hold for 5 seconds at the top
  - Add a slight head turn left and right while holding
  - Remove towel support
  - Rest 30 seconds between sets

### Advanced Variation
- **Duration per session**: 15-20 repetitions, 3 sets
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Intensity**: Full range of motion with resistance
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Lift head to maximum comfortable height
  - Hold for 8-10 seconds with strong contraction
  - Add manual resistance by pressing gently on forehead while lifting
  - Perform "pulses" at the top - small up-and-down movements
  - Combine with side-to-side head movements

## Common Mistakes
- **Using hands to pull**: Never pull on your head; hands should only provide light support or stay at sides
- **Engaging abs**: Focus on using neck muscles only; don't crunch with your core
- **Lifting too high**: You only need to clear the floor slightly; excessive height strains muscles
- **Holding breath**: Breathe normally throughout the movement
- **Jerky movements**: Use slow, controlled motions both up and down
- **Not tucking chin**: Failing to tuck chin reduces platysma engagement
- **Tongue not engaged**: Keep tongue pressed to roof of mouth throughout

## Expected Results
- **Timeline**:
  - Initial muscle awareness: 1-2 weeks
  - Strength improvement: 3-4 weeks
  - Visible toning: 6-8 weeks
  - Noticeable definition: 2-4 months
- **What to expect**:
  - Stronger front neck muscles
  - Improved platysma tone
  - Reduced appearance of double chin
  - Better neck muscle control
  - More defined jawline contour
  - Results best when combined with overall fat loss
