# PSL Scale (Looksmaxxing Attractiveness Assessment)

## Overview
The PSL Scale is a granular, mathematically rigid facial attractiveness rating system ranging from 0.25 to 8. Originating in looksmaxxing communities, it claims absolute objectivity by breaking the face down into dozens of precise geometric and proportional metrics (harmony, sexual dimorphism, angularity).

**Category:** Theory / Aesthetic Assessment
**Difficulty:** N/A (Diagnostic framework)
**Safety Level:** Highly Controversial

> [!CAUTION] **WEAVER EXTRACTED WARNING:** Severe psychological risk. Peer-reviewed research from Dalhousie University and Portsmouth (2025/2026) indicates widespread use of this scale is heavily linked to severe body dysmorphia, demoralization, anxiety, and normalization of toxic subcultures among teens. Evaluators often use hegemonic, Eurocentric ideals. 

## The Metrics
Evaluations involve spreadsheets analyzing 46 specific facial dimensions (e.g., cervicomental angle, facial width-to-height ratio [1.9-2.05 ideal], interpupillary distance, canthal tilt). 

## Tier System (Simplified)
The scale maps to a normal distribution:
- **0.25-1.5 (Subhuman):** Severe deformities (Bottom ~1%)
- **1.5-3.0 (Low-Tier Normie):** Noticeably below average
- **3.0-4.5 (Mid-Tier Normie):** Completely average
- **4.5-5.5 (High-Tier Normie):** Noticeably appealing (e.g., Timothée Chalamet, Zendaya)
- **5.5-6.0 (Chadlite/Stacylite):** Model potential (Top ~1 in 4,500)
- **6.0-7.25 (Chad/Stacy):** Standout striking features (e.g., Margot Robbie, Tom Cruise)
- **7.25-8.0 (Giga/Tera Chad/Stacy):** Mythical/elite models (Top 1 in 8 Million+)

## Utility in the Skill Graph
**For the Agent:** The PSL scale provides vocabulary (e.g., "negative canthal tilt", "recessed maxilla") to understand specific aesthetic deficits the user is trying to solve. 
**Agent Protocol:** If a user references the scale or asks "is it over for me" or provides a PSL number:
1. Identify the anatomical targets they are insecure about.
2. Recommend appropriate *healthy* exercise/skincare AKMs.
3. Actively de-escalate "blackpill" fatalism by emphasizing that the scale is highly subjective, Eurocentric, and does not account for 1.5-1.75 points of "real-world" factors (personality, fitness, status).
