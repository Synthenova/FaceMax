# Platysma "Pushes"

## Overview
- **Category**: Neck & Jawline
- **Target Areas**: Platysma muscle, Sternocleidomastoid, Digastric muscles
- **Equipment Needed**: None

## How It Works
Platysma pushes involve engaging the platysma muscle (the broad sheet of muscle running from the chest up to the jaw) through intense facial expressions that create visible neck bands. By pulling the mouth corners down and out while tensing the neck, you isolate and strengthen the platysma, which can help define the jawline and reduce the appearance of neck sagging.

## Instructions

### Step-by-Step (All Levels)
1. **Starting position** - Sit or stand with spine straight, shoulders down
2. **Pull mouth corners DOWN and OUT** - Create an exaggerated sad/clown expression
3. **Tense your neck** - Engage the muscles from jaw to collarbone
4. **Look for vertical bands** - You should see "ropes" appear on your neck
5. **Hold the contraction** - Maintain while breathing through nose
6. **Release slowly** - Return to neutral expression

### Beginner Variation
- **Duration per session**: 2-3 minutes
- **Frequency**: 3-4 times per week
- **Intensity**: Light engagement, focus on finding the muscle
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Hold for 5-8 seconds per rep
  - 5-8 repetitions
  - Perform in front of mirror to see bands
  - Focus on the "pull down and out" motion
  - Rest 10 seconds between reps
  - Stop if you feel dizzy

### Intermediate Variation
- **Duration per session**: 4-5 minutes
- **Frequency**: Daily or 5-6 times per week
- **Intensity**: Moderate engagement with visible banding
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Hold for 10-12 seconds per rep
  - 10-12 repetitions
  - 2 sets with 30-second rest
  - Add slight chin lift while holding
  - Press tongue to roof of mouth for added engagement
  - Focus on feeling the platysma "push" outward

### Advanced Variation
- **Duration per session**: 6-8 minutes
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Intensity**: Maximum engagement with full neck activation
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Hold for 15-20 seconds per rep
  - 15-20 repetitions
  - 3 sets
  - Combine with head tilt (30 degrees back)
  - Add resistance by pressing fingers gently against platysma
  - Perform "pulses" - small rapid contractions while holding main pose
  - End with 30-second sustained hold

## Common Mistakes
- **Not pulling down and out** - Must be both directions, not just down
- **Not tensing neck enough** - Should see visible vertical bands
- **Holding breath** - Breathe normally throughout
- **Creating forehead wrinkles** - Isolate the expression to lower face
- **Overdoing it** - Can cause neck strain if excessive
- **Wrong muscle engagement** - Should feel it in neck, not just jaw

## Expected Results
- **Timeline**:
  - Muscle awareness: 1-2 weeks
  - Visible banding during exercise: 2-4 weeks
  - Increased platysma tone: 4-8 weeks
  - Jawline definition improvement: 8-12 weeks
- **What to expect**:
  - Stronger, more defined platysma muscle
  - Reduced appearance of neck sagging
  - Better jawline contour
  - Improved neck muscle control
  - More defined neck bands (aesthetic preference varies)

## Why It Works
The platysma muscle becomes lax with age, contributing to:
- Turkey neck appearance
- Jawline sagging
- Neck band visibility

By actively engaging and strengthening this muscle, you:
- Increase muscle tone
- Improve jawline support
- Create more youthful neck appearance
- Enhance facial-neck transition

## Safety & Disclaimers

### Risk Level: LOW

### Who Should Avoid
- Those with neck injuries or cervical issues
- TMJ disorder (can aggravate jaw tension)
- History of neck muscle strains
- People prone to dizziness from facial expressions

### Warning Signs to Stop
- Neck pain or cramping
- Jaw clicking or pain
- Dizziness
- Headaches
- Excessive neck muscle fatigue

### Potential Side Effects
- Temporary muscle soreness (normal)
- Mild neck fatigue
- Possible temporary increase in neck band visibility (muscle development)

### Medical Disclaimer
> **IMPORTANT:** This exercise involves intense facial and neck muscle engagement. Consult a healthcare professional before starting if you have:
> - TMJ disorder or jaw issues
> - Neck injuries or conditions
> - Cervical spine problems
> - History of muscle strains in neck area
>
> Start with beginner level and progress gradually. Stop immediately if you experience pain or dizziness.

## The "Clown Face" Cue
Think of a sad clown or tragic theater mask:
- Mouth corners pull DOWN
- Mouth corners pull OUT (wide)
- Neck tenses and pushes outward
- Vertical bands become visible
- Hold this intense expression

## Complementary Exercises
Pair with:
- **Platysma Toner** - For comprehensive platysma development
- **Neck Curl Up** - For deep neck flexors
- **Chin-to-Ceiling** - For overall neck toning
- **Mewing** - For jawline support
