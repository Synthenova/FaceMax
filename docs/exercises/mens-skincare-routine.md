## The Science of Men's Skin

### Key Differences from Women's Skin
| Factor | Men's Skin | Implication |
|--------|------------|-------------|
| Thickness | 20-25% thicker | More resilient but needs deeper cleansing |
| Collagen density | Higher | Ages slower but still needs protection |
| Sebum production | 2x more oily | Prone to clogged pores, acne |
| Facial hair | Constant shaving | Irritation, ingrown hairs |
| pH level | More acidic | Different product needs |

### Why Skincare Matters for Facial Aesthetics
1. **Texture:** Smooth skin reflects light better
2. **Tone:** Even skin tone looks healthier
3. **Clarity:** Clear skin doesn't distract from features
4. **Aging:** Prevention is easier than correction
5. **Confidence:** Good skin improves how you feel

2. **Apply cleanser** (dime-sized amount)
3. **Massage gently** for 30-60 seconds
4. **Focus on:** T-zone (forehead, nose, chin)
5. **Rinse thoroughly** - no residue
6. **Pat dry** with clean towel (don't rub)

#### Choosing a Cleanser
| Skin Type | Recommended Cleanser Type | Key Ingredients |
