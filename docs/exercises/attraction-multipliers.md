# Attraction Multipliers

## Overview
A strategic framework for maximizing attractiveness by focusing on multiplicative improvements rather than additive ones. The concept teaches that small optimizations across multiple areas (tan, body care, fitted clothing) create exponential visual impact rather than linear addition.

**Time per Session:** N/A
**Frequency:** N/A

## The Framework
1. **Foundation First** - Build base attractiveness (muscle, fat loss, skincare, dental) before adding multipliers
2. **Multipliers Over Addition** - Optimize existing assets rather than adding more work
3. **Identify Depreciation Factors** - Fix negative multipliers (bad breath, poor hygiene) that destroy all other efforts
4. **Sequence Correctly** - Foundation → Multipliers → High-risk/high-reward optimizations
5. **Get Objective Feedback** - Use reference looksmaxxing and AI tools to avoid "eyebrow blindness"

## Expected Results
- Maximized visual impact with less effort
- Proper sequencing prevents wasted work
- Awareness of negative multipliers that sabotage attractiveness

## Scientific Basis
The framework is experiential/marketing-based rather than rigorously scientific. It applies the mathematical concept of multiplication to attractiveness optimization.
