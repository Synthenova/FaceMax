# FaceMax Project Guide

> **Current Phase:** Planning & Research  
> **Next Milestone:** Phase 1 (MVP) Development

## Project Overview
FaceMax is a looks-focused self-improvement app helping men maximize their facial aesthetics ("looksmaxxing") through **science-backed daily routines**, **AI progress tracking**, and **community accountability**. It moves beyond simple "face ratings" (competitor standard) to provide actionable, guided improvement plans.

## Core Rules for Development
1. **Routines First:** The app is about *doing*, not just *rating*. Prioritize exercise timers and trackers.
2. **Tech Stack:** React Native (Expo), Firebase (Auth/Firestore), Gemini Flash (AI), TensorFlow Lite (On-device).
3. **Design:** Dark, premium, masculine (Oura/Whoop aesthetic).
4. **Ethics:** No toxicity. Science-backed advice only.
