## Question 1: Popular Looksmaxxing & Face Maxxing iPhone Apps

### AI-Generated Summary

If you're interested in looksmaxxing or face maxxing using iPhone apps, here are some popular options and insights from Redditors:

### Popular Looksmaxxing Apps

#### 1. Umax
**Target Audience:** Primarily men (originally men-only)

**Features:**
- Overall and max potential attractiveness ratings
- Jawline, cheekbones, and skin quality ratings
- Canthal tilt analysis
- Generic tips on how to improve each category
- Face shape analysis

**Cost:** $5.99 weekly (with add-ons for more $)

**Verdict:** Mixed feelings about accuracy and usefulness. It feels like the app shows your photo to ChatGPT or something and requests a value for each category. It seems mildly accurate but users don't really know what to do with this information.

**User Rating:** 5/10

---

#### 2. Glam Up
**Target Audience:** Women

**Features:**
- A "yassified" photo of yourself (a filter thrown on your face)
- Face shape, skin type, eye shape, undertone, eye color, hair color analysis
- Basic "guide" on what makeup to wear

**Cost:** $4.99-$8.99 weekly (4 types of scans; $4.99 gets you 1, $8.99 gets you all 4)

**Verdict:** Generally NOT recommended due to gimmicky features. Users reported being "scared" by their yassified photo and not getting anything useful out of it. All scans are described as "pretty bad / gimmicky."

**User Rating:** 1.5/10

---

#### 3. Looksglo
**Target Audience:** Less gendered (95% women users), newest of the 3 apps

**Features:**
- Skin age, canthal tilt, face shape, skin type analysis
- Facial thirds % and values for 6 attributes (hydration, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, etc.)
- 10 Face maps of your skin (like physical skin analysis machines)
- Qoves-style mathematical info about facial proportions and symmetry
- Top 2 celebrity lookalikes with guides on how to copy their look
- Reddit-esque forum for getting and giving advice

**Cost:** $9.99 weekly OR $35 for one year (best value)

**Verdict:** Highly recommended. The face maps are actually helpful - showing every pimple/closed comedone/pigmented mark in colored boxes, proving the app isn't just throwing filters on or asking ChatGPT to generate numbers. Celebrity lookalikes were accurate. The forum is surprisingly active with helpful, serious users. If you're most interested in improving your skin, this app excels.

**User Rating:** 9.25/10

---

### Additional Insights

#### Face ID Issues
Some users have reported issues with Face ID on newer iPhone models running iOS 26:
- FaceID has been slower to respond on iOS 26
- Sometimes doesn't work and requires passcode entry
- iPhone 13 with iOS 16 works flawlessly in comparison

**Troubleshooting Tips:**
1. **Reset Face ID:** Delete your Face ID profiles completely, turn it off, then turn it back on and set it up again
2. **Clean Front Camera:** Ensure your front camera area is clean to avoid recognition issues

#### Settings Search Problems
iOS 26 has been criticized for its settings search functionality, making it harder to find specific features.

#### Source 2: My Hellish Life (r/shortguys)

**Summary:** A raw personal account of lifelong bullying and discrimination due to height:

- Bullied from age 6-7 through early 20s
- Disrespected by family, friends, teachers, classmates, and strangers

- Attempted transformation through gym, social skills, and looksmaxxing
- Still faces discrimination despite efforts
