## 1. Movement Overview

**Looksmaxxing** (and its subset **facemaxing**) is an online self-improvement movement — primarily male, ages 14–30 — centered on maximizing physical attractiveness through deliberate, daily practices. The movement originated in incel forums in the early 2010s but went mainstream on TikTok and YouTube from 2023 onward. The hashtag `#looksmaxxing` has accumulated **billions** of views on TikTok alone.

### Terminology Cheat Sheet

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Softmaxxing** | Non-surgical, low-risk improvements — skincare, grooming, posture, exercise. **This is the sweet spot for FaceMax.** |
| **Hardmaxxing** | Surgical or high-risk interventions — rhinoplasty, jaw implants, fillers, bone smashing. Out of scope for our app. |
| **Mewing** | Tongue posture technique (pressing tongue flat against palate) to reshape jawline over time. |
| **Bonesmashing** | Striking facial bones with blunt objects to cause micro-fractures — **dangerous, not recommended.** |
| **PSL** | "Perfectly Symmetrical Looks" — a rating scale used in the community. |
| **Mogging** | Appearing more attractive than someone nearby by comparison. |
| **Hunter Eyes** | Almond-shaped, slightly hooded eyes considered the ideal. |
| **Auramaxxing** | Maximizing non-physical attractiveness — body language, confidence, presence. |
| **Smellmaxxing / Scentmaxxing** | Fragrance optimization. |

### Audience Profile

- **Core demographic:** Male, 14–30 years old, Gen Z and Gen Alpha.
- **Platforms:** TikTok (primary discovery), YouTube (long-form how-to), Instagram (transformation reels), Reddit (r/looksmaxxing, r/orthotropics), dedicated forums (Looksmax.org, Mogwarts Academy).
- **Motivations:** Confidence, dating success, self-improvement, peer pressure, social media appearance pressure.
- **Spending habits:** Willing to buy low-cost tools (gua sha stones, jawline gum, derma rollers, skincare) — typically $10–$50 per product. Subscription coaching ($19–$99/month) is growing.

## 2. Influencer Landscape (Male-Focused)

### Tier 1 — Major Influencers (500K+ followers)

| Influencer | Platforms | Followers (approx.) | Focus | Monetization | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dillon Latham** | TikTok, YouTube | ~1.7M (TikTok) | Softmaxxing tips, side profile hacks, teeth whitening, general looksmaxxing | Product endorsements, brand deals | One of the most recognized faces in the space. Controversial at times (e.g., hydrogen peroxide teeth whitening claims). Produces high-volume short-form content. |
| **QOVES Studio** | YouTube, Website | ~965K (YouTube) | Science-based facial aesthetics analysis | Facial analysis reports ($150–$300), podcast ("Glow Up"), consulting | The most credible voice in the space. Run by researchers and medical professionals. Analyzes 100+ facial features. Positioned as premium/educational, not hype. **Strong reference for our app's analytical angle.** |
| **Brett Maverick** | YouTube, TikTok | ~1.5M (YouTube) | Male glow-up guides, skincare, haircare, style | Jawliner gum endorsement, Tiege Hanley skincare sponsorship | Content is accessible and practical. Published a "100 Glow Up Tips" series. Covers face, skin, hair, and style. Good balance of depth and entertainment. |
| **Kalosique** | YouTube, Skool | ~400K+ (YouTube) | Comprehensive looksmaxxing, supplement stacks, 1-on-1 coaching | Supplements line (kalosique.com), coaching ($), Skool community | Sells a full "Looksmaxxing Masterclass" and "Height Growth Masterclass" on Skool. Active community with paid membership. Posts tier lists and debunk content. |
| **Kareem Shami (SyrianPsycho)** | TikTok, Instagram | ~1.8M (TikTok) | Facemaxxing, hunter eyes, mewing, auramaxxing | Mogwarts Academy ($19/month subscription) | Runs "Mogwarts Academy" — a subscription-based looksmaxxing school with courses (Looksmaxxing 101) and community message boards. Before-and-after transformations are his main hook. |
| **Clavicular** | TikTok, YouTube | ~500K+ | Bonesmashing, extreme looksmaxxing | Donations, brand deals, supplements | **Controversial.** Promotes bonesmashing (hitting face with blunt objects). Recently reported to have undergone limb-lengthening surgery. Represents the extreme end — **not a model for our app**, but worth monitoring as a cultural signal. |

### Tier 2 — Mid-Tier Specialists (100K–500K)

| Influencer | Platforms | Focus | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Marcos Philip (@itsmarcosphilip)** | TikTok | Jawline exercises, facial exercises for men, gua sha tutorials | Very practical, step-by-step format. Focuses specifically on jaw and cheek exercises. 7 exercises for a sharper jawline is his signature content. Also covers gua sha for men. |
| **Oscar Patel** | TikTok | Mewing tutorials, PSL ratings | UK-based. ~188K TikTok followers. Focuses heavily on mewing technique and facial structure analysis. |
| **Mike Mew (Dr. Mew)** | YouTube | Orthotropics, mewing (creator) | The originator of mewing. British orthodontist. ~1M+ YouTube subscribers. Launched the "Mewing by Dr Mike Mew" app. His father John Mew lost his medical license for unsubstantiated claims — controversy follows the family, but the technique has massive cultural adoption. |
| **Alex Costa** | YouTube | Male grooming, hair, skincare | ~3M subs. More mainstream grooming than hardcore looksmaxxing, but significant crossover audience. |
| **Tommy B** | YouTube | Skincare routines for men | Dermatologist-adjacent content. Morning/night skincare routines tailored for male skin. |

### Tier 3 — Niche / Emerging

| Influencer | Platform | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **FragranceKnowledge** | TikTok (~1M) | Scentmaxxing — cologne reviews (not face-focused but overlaps the audience) |
| **Jeremy Fragrance** | TikTok (~10M) | Fragrance — massive reach in the male self-improvement space |
| **Jawzrsize (brand)** | Instagram, YouTube | Jawline exercise tools — acts as an influencer brand |

### Key Observations

1. **No single dominant "facemaxing" app influencer exists yet.** The opportunity is open.
2. **Science-based credibility (QOVES) beats bro-science hype** for long-term trust.
3. **Short-form video (TikTok, Shorts) drives discovery**, but YouTube long-form drives conversions (course sales, coaching, apps).
4. **Subscription communities (Skool, Mogwarts) are the dominant monetization model** — $19–$99/month.
5. **Controversy is common.** Bonesmashing, unverified claims, and incel associations are real risks. FaceMax should position itself firmly in the **safe, science-backed softmaxxing** lane.

## 3. Technique Catalog

### 3.1 Jawline & Facial Structure

#### Mewing (Tongue Posture)
- **What:** Keep lips sealed, teeth lightly together, tongue pressed flat against the roof of the mouth (entire tongue, not just the tip). Breathe through the nose.
- **Time commitment:** Ideally maintained all day; conscious practice 5–10 min/day initially.
- **Cost:** Free.
- **Timeframe for results:** 6–24 months (anecdotal). Most noticeable in younger users (<25) whose bones are still malleable.
- **Risk:** Very low. Orthodontic establishment is skeptical of structural claims but acknowledges benefits for nasal breathing and tongue posture.
- **Promoted by:** Mike Mew, Oscar Patel, Kareem Shami, virtually everyone in the space.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Perfect for a daily habit tracker. Can teach proper tongue placement with step-by-step guide.

#### Jawline Exercises (Face Gym)
- **What:** Targeted exercises to strengthen masseter and jaw muscles:
  - **Jawline Squeeze** — clench jaw, hold 10s, release. 3 sets of 10.
  - **Chin Lift** — tilt head back, push lower jaw forward, hold 10s.
  - **Vowel Sounds** — exaggerate A-E-I-O-U mouth movements. 3 sets of 10.

- **Time commitment:** 5–10 min/day.
- **Cost:** Free.
- **Timeframe:** 4–8 weeks for visible toning.

- **App opportunity:** ✅ Ideal for guided exercise routines with timers and rep counters.

#### Hard Chewing (Jawline Gum / Mastic Gum)
- **What:** Chewing extra-hard gum (mastic gum, Jawliner, Falim gum) to hypertrophy the masseter muscle.
- **Time commitment:** 20–30 min/day.
- **Cost:** ~$10–$25/month (Jawliner gum, mastic gum).
- **Timeframe:** 4–12 weeks.
- **Risk:** Moderate — can cause TMJ disorder if overdone. Start slow (5 min/day) and increase gradually.
- **Promoted by:** Brett Maverick (Jawliner endorser), Jawzrsize.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Timer-based routine with progressive difficulty guidance and rest-day reminders.

#### Gua Sha Facial Massage
- **What:** Using a flat stone tool (jade or rose quartz) to scrape along the jawline, cheekbones, and forehead for lymphatic drainage and facial depuffing.

  - **Step 5:** Scrape forehead upward.
- **Time commitment:** 3–5 min/day.
- **Cost:** $5–$20 (one-time tool cost).
- **Timeframe:** Immediate depuffing visible same-day; structural claims are unproven but lymphatic drainage is medically supported.
- **Risk:** Very low. Avoid pressing too hard on delicate skin.
- **Promoted by:** Marcos Philip, GQ, Healthline, Instagram beauty community.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Visual step-by-step tutorial, daily reminder, AM routine staple.

- **Promoted by:** General grooming community, Brett Maverick.

### 3.2 Skin Care

#### The Essential Daily Routine (Dermatologist-Backed)

This is the **core skin stack** promoted by virtually every credible male grooming influencer and backed by dermatologists (GQ, Vogue, Men's Health, Byrdie):

**Morning:**
1. **Gentle Cleanser** — CeraVe, Cetaphil, or equivalent. Removes overnight oil without stripping.
2. **Vitamin C Serum** — Antioxidant protection, brightening, collagen support.
3. **Moisturizer** — Lightweight, non-comedogenic (CeraVe PM, Neutrogena Hydro Boost).
4. **Sunscreen (SPF 30+)** — **The single most important anti-aging product.** UV damage is the #1 cause of premature aging. Mineral or chemical — both work.

**Evening:**
1. **Cleanser** — Same as morning or double-cleanse (oil cleanser first, then water-based).
2. **Retinol/Retinoid** — Vitamin A derivative. Increases cell turnover, reduces wrinkles, clears acne, boosts collagen. Start low (0.25%–0.5%) 2–3x/week, build up.
3. **Moisturizer** — Heavier than morning is fine.

**Weekly Add-ons:**
- **Chemical Exfoliant** — BHA (salicylic acid) or AHA (glycolic acid) 1–2x/week. Removes dead skin, refines pores.
- **Clay / Charcoal Mask** — 1x/week for deep pore cleansing.
- **Hydrating Sheet Mask** — 1x/week for an extra moisture boost.

- **Cost:** ~$30–$80/month for a complete starter routine (drugstore brands).
- **Risk:** Very low. Retinol can cause irritation initially — start slow. Sunscreen is universally recommended.
- **Referenced by:** GQ, Vogue, Byrdie, Men's Health, CeraVe / La Roche-Posay marketing, Tommy B, Brett Maverick.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ **High value.** Morning + evening routine tracker, product recommendations, progress photos for before/after tracking.

#### Dermarolling / Microneedling (At-Home)
- **What:** Using a roller with tiny needles (0.25mm–0.5mm for home use) on the face to stimulate collagen production.
- **Time commitment:** 1–2x/week, 5 min per session.
- **Cost:** ~$10–$30 (derma roller) + serum.
- **Timeframe:** 4–12 weeks for visible improvement in skin texture and scarring.
- **Risk:** Moderate. Must be done on clean skin with a clean, sharp roller. Deeper needles (1.0mm+) should be professional only. Never use on active acne.
- **Promoted by:** Softmaxxing community, skincare influencers.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Weekly reminder, hygiene and safety checklist, roller replacement reminders.

#### Hydration & Diet (Internal Skin Health)
- **What:** Drinking 2–3L water/day, reducing sugar/dairy/processed food intake, increasing omega-3s and antioxidant-rich foods.
- **Time commitment:** Lifestyle change — daily.
- **Cost:** Negligible (may actually save money).
- **Timeframe:** 2–4 weeks for noticeable skin improvement.
- **Risk:** None.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Water tracker, simple diet tips.

### 3.3 Hair

#### Face-Framing Hairstyle
- **What:** Choosing a haircut that complements face shape and enhances jawline/cheekbone appearance. Key principles:
  - **Round face** → Add volume on top, shorter sides (fade, undercut).
  - **Long face** → Avoid too much top height; side volume and fringe help.
  - **Square face** → Most styles work; textured crops and side parts enhance angularity.
  - **Oval face** → Versatile; nearly any style works.
- **The "Curtain Bangs / Fluffy" Look:** 2024–2026's most popular men's hairstyle in the looksmaxxing community. Soft, textured, face-framing.
- **Cost:** Haircut ($20–$50) + styling product ($10–$20).
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Face shape analysis → haircut recommendation engine (could use AI/photo analysis).

#### Hair Health Basics
- **What:**
  - Use sulfate-free shampoo (2–3x/week, not daily).
  - Condition after every wash.
  - Use a leave-in conditioner or argan oil for texture and shine.
  - Avoid excessive heat styling.
  - Scalp massage (2–3 min/day) for blood flow and hair growth.
- **Cost:** ~$15–$30/month.
- **Promoted by:** Alex Costa, Brett Maverick.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Hair wash schedule tracker, product suggestions by hair type.

#### Hair Loss Prevention (Low-Cost)
- **What:** For those noticing early thinning:
  - **Minoxidil (Rogaine)** — OTC topical, applied 1–2x/day. ~$15–$30/month.
  - **Scalp massage** — 5 min/day for blood circulation.
  - **Biotin supplement** — common but evidence is mixed.
  - **Derma rolling the scalp** — 1x/week with 0.5mm–1.0mm roller to improve minoxidil absorption.
- **Risk:** Minoxidil is generally safe; may cause initial shedding. Not suitable for everyone.
- **App opportunity:** ⚠️ Sensitive topic — handle with empathy. Optional module for users who opt in.

### 3.4 Eyes & Eyebrows

#### Eyebrow Grooming
- **What:** One of the highest-ROI grooming changes a man can make. Cleans up the face dramatically.
  - **Threading or waxing** the unibrow and stray hairs.
  - **Shaping** — maintain natural arch; don't over-pluck.
  - **Tinting** — darkening brows for a more defined look (~$15–$25 per session, lasts 4–6 weeks). Can be done at home with drugstore kits ($8–$12).
  - **Brow gel** — keeps hairs in place for a groomed look ($5–$10).
- **Time commitment:** 5 min/week maintenance after initial shaping.
- **Cost:** $0 (DIY tweeze) to $25 (professional threading/tinting).
- **Promoted by:** Brett Maverick (Glow Up Tip #3), general grooming influencers.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Before/after tutorial, maintenance reminders.

#### Under-Eye Care
- **What:** Reducing dark circles and puffiness:
  - **Sleep** — 7–9 hours consistently is the #1 fix.
  - **Caffeine eye cream** — reduces puffiness (The Ordinary Caffeine Solution, ~$7).
  - **Cold compress / cold spoons** — 2 min in the morning.
  - **Retinol eye cream** — long-term collagen building.
  - **Reduce sodium intake** — minimizes water retention / puffiness.
- **Cost:** $7–$20.
- **App opportunity:** ✅ Sleep tracker integration, morning eye-care step in routine.

#### "Hunter Eyes" Training
- **What:** The community's term for slightly narrow, almond-shaped, hooded eyes that project confidence. Techniques promoted:
  - **Squinting exercises** — strengthening the orbicularis oculi muscle.
  - **Reducing upper eyelid exposure** through better brow position (mewing allegedly helps).
  - **Sleep position** — sleeping on back to avoid facial puffiness and asymmetry.
- **Time commitment:** Minimal — mostly awareness-based.
- **Risk:** Very low (exercises). The "hunter eyes" ideal can be problematic if it fuels body dysmorphia — **handle carefully in app.**
- **App opportunity:** ⚠️ Include as "eye area care" rather than chasing a specific eye shape.

## 5. Competitor Apps

### Direct Competitors (Face Rating / Looksmaxxing)

| App | Platforms | Features | Monetization | Downloads / Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Umax** | iOS, Android | AI face rating, jawline scan, beard/haircut suggestions, daily tips | Freemium + subscription | Most popular in the category. Recently updated (Feb 2026). Heavy on AI facial analysis. Suggests improvements per feature. |
| **LooksMax AI** | iOS, Android | Photo upload → AI face analysis → trait scoring → improvement suggestions | Subscription | Skincare, hairstyle, and general attractiveness suggestions. Strong App Store presence. |
| **Looksmaxxing – AI Face Rating** (Prodigy AI) | iOS | Face scoring, feature-by-feature rating | Subscription | Simpler — focused on the "rating" novelty. Less on routines. |
| **Youmax: AI Looksmax** | Android | AI face analyzer, jawline detection, attractiveness rating | Freemium | Newer entrant. Similar rating-focused approach. |
| **Mewing by Dr Mike Mew** | iOS, Android | Mewing instruction, tongue posture guide, progress tracking | Subscription | Official app from the mewing creator. Narrow focus (mewing only). |

### Indirect Competitors

| App | Focus | Relevance |
|---|---|---|
| **Skincare routine apps** (TroveSkin, Skinive) | Skin tracking, product recommendations | Adjacent — skin-only, not facemaxing-holistic |
| **Habit trackers** (Streaks, Habitica, Done) | General daily habits | Could be used for facemaxing, but not purpose-built |
| **Face Yoga apps** (Face Yoga by Koko, Luvly) | Facial exercises | Primarily female audience; exercises overlap but branding is wrong for male users |

### Competitive Gap Analysis

**What existing apps do well:**
- AI face rating / scoring is a proven hook for downloads and virality.
- Quick, visual feedback drives engagement.

**What existing apps do NOT do well (and FaceMax can own):**
1. **No structured daily routines.** They rate your face but don't give you a daily action plan.
2. **No progress tracking over time.** Face rating is a snapshot, not a journey.
3. **No technique library with guided execution.** No timers, step-by-step videos, or exercise guides.
4. **No retention mechanics.** No streaks, challenges, or milestone rewards.
5. **No community / social proof.** No before/after sharing, no accountability.
6. **No holistic coverage.** They focus on one thing (rating or mewing) — none cover skin + jaw + hair + eyes as a unified routine.

**FaceMax's differentiation opportunity:**
- **Routine-first, not rating-first.** The app's core loop is "follow your daily routine" — not "get your score."
- **Multi-area coverage** — jawline, skin, hair, eyes in one app.
- **Guided execution** — timers, video demos, step-by-step.
- **Progress journey** — weekly progress photos, streak tracking, milestone celebrations.
- **Safe & science-backed positioning** — explicitly not bonesmashing / hardmaxxing.

## 6. Key Takeaways for FaceMax App

### Content Strategy
1. **Core daily routine should have 5–8 steps** covering jawline (mewing + exercises), skincare (AM/PM split), and one rotating focus (gua sha, eyebrows, hair, etc.).
2. **Progressive difficulty** — start with a "Beginner" routine (3–4 steps, 5 min/day) and graduate to "Advanced" (8–10 steps, 15–20 min/day).
3. **The "morning face check"** — ice + gua sha + sunscreen can be a signature FaceMax morning ritual.
4. **Weekly challenges** keep things fresh: "Mewing consistency week," "Hydration challenge," "Posture week."

### Positioning
- **Brand voice:** Confident but not toxic. Self-improvement without self-hatred. Aspirational but grounded. Think QOVES credibility + Brett Maverick accessibility.
- **Explicitly distance from:** Bonesmashing, incel terminology, misogyny, body dysmorphia triggers.
- **Lean into:** Science-backed claims, dermatologist references, before/after progress, community positivity.

### Influencer Partnership Opportunities
1. **Brett Maverick** — natural fit. Already endorses similar products. Could co-create a "Brett's Routine" in-app.
2. **Marcos Philip** — jawline exercise specialist. Could provide video content for exercise guides.
3. **QOVES Studio** — premium credibility. A "Powered by QOVES Science" badge would be high-trust.
4. **Kalosique** — active community builder. Could cross-promote to his Skool audience.

### Monetization Signals from the Market
- **Subscription ($9.99–$19.99/month)** — proven in this space (Mogwarts, Umax, LooksMax AI).
- **AI face analysis as a hook** — free first scan, detailed report behind paywall.
- **In-app product recommendations** — affiliate revenue from skincare, gua sha tools, jawline gum.
- **Coaching upsell** — premium tier with personalized routines.
