# Mewing (Proper Tongue Posture)

## Overview
- **Category**: Jawline & Structural
- **Target Areas**: Tongue, Palate, Jaw muscles, Maxilla, Upper jaw structure
- **Equipment Needed**: None

## How It Works
Mewing is a technique that involves maintaining proper tongue posture by resting the entire tongue against the roof of the mouth. The theory is that consistent pressure from the tongue against the palate can influence facial structure over time, potentially widening the maxilla and improving jawline definition. The practice engages the genioglossus muscle and other tongue muscles, promoting better oral posture and nasal breathing.

## Instructions

### Step-by-Step (All Levels)
1. **Close your mouth** gently with lips sealed but not forced together
2. **Place the tip of your tongue** just behind your upper front teeth (on the "r" spot where the alveolar ridge meets the hard palate)
3. **Flatten the middle and back of your tongue** against the roof of your mouth
4. **Apply gentle, even pressure** upward and forward - you should feel slight tension under your jaw
5. **Breathe through your nose** while maintaining this position
6. **Swallow correctly** - practice swallowing without moving your face or neck muscles, using only your tongue

### Beginner Variation
- **Duration per session**: Start with 5-10 minutes of conscious practice
- **Frequency**: Multiple reminders throughout the day; aim for constant awareness
- **Intensity**: Gentle pressure - about 20-30% of maximum effort
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Use the "ng" sound (like in "sing") to find the correct back tongue position
  - Practice in front of a mirror to ensure you're not clenching teeth
  - Set hourly reminders to check tongue posture

### Intermediate Variation
- **Duration per session**: Maintain posture for 30-60 minutes at a time
- **Frequency**: Throughout the day with increasing consistency
- **Intensity**: Moderate pressure - about 40-50% of maximum effort
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Practice during daily activities (walking, working, reading)
  - Focus on keeping the back third of tongue engaged
  - Work on proper swallowing technique without facial movement

### Advanced Variation
- **Duration per session**: Maintain posture consistently throughout the day
- **Frequency**: All waking hours (except during eating/speaking)
- **Intensity**: Firm but comfortable pressure - 50-60% of maximum effort
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Combine with "suction hold" technique - create vacuum seal without teeth contact
  - Practice during sleep (requires high consistency during day first)
  - Perfect the "mewing swallow" - swallowing with tongue only, zero facial movement

## Common Mistakes
- **Tongue touching teeth**: The tip should rest just behind teeth, not pressing on them - this can cause forward teeth movement
- **Only front tongue up**: Many beginners only raise the front portion; the entire tongue including the back third must be engaged
- **Uneven pressure**: Applying more pressure on one side can lead to facial asymmetry over time
- **Teeth clenching**: Mewing should not involve biting down or teeth contact; lips closed, teeth slightly apart
- **Mouth breathing**: Cannot mew effectively while breathing through mouth; nasal breathing is essential
- **Not enough tongue space**: Some people have anatomically restricted tongue space; forcing it can cause issues
- **Expecting quick results**: Mewing requires months to years of consistency; it's a lifestyle change, not a quick fix

## Expected Results
- **Timeline**:
  - Posture awareness: 2-4 weeks
  - Breathing improvements: 1-3 months
  - Subtle structural changes (if any): 6 months - 2+ years
- **What to expect**:
  - Improved nasal breathing
  - Better tongue muscle control and awareness
  - Potential subtle changes in facial structure (highly individual)
  - Improved swallowing mechanics
  - Results vary significantly by age (younger individuals may see more change)

## Safety & Disclaimers

### Risk Level: LOW

### Who Should Avoid
- Those with TMJ disorder (consult specialist first)
- Active orthodontic treatment (consult orthodontist)
- Severe sleep apnea (not a substitute for medical treatment)
- Children (should be supervised by orthodontist)

### Warning Signs to Stop
- Sharp pain in jaw or teeth
- Headaches
- TMJ clicking or popping
- Tooth movement
- Asymmetry developing

### Potential Side Effects
- Temporary tongue fatigue (normal)
- Mild jaw discomfort during adaptation
- Possible tooth movement if pressing on teeth

### Medical Disclaimer
> **IMPORTANT:** Mewing is a technique popularized through social media with limited scientific evidence for structural changes in adults. Consult a healthcare professional before starting, especially if you have:
> - TMJ disorder or jaw pain
> - Dental issues or orthodontic appliances
> - Sleep apnea
> - Any concerns about oral health
>
> This is not medical advice. Individual results vary significantly.
