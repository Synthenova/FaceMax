## Research & Documentation Protocol

When asked to research a topic or develop a section of the app:

1. **Produce a complete, engineer-handoff-quality Markdown file** and place it in `/docs`.
2. **Before creating anything new**, read the existing file (and any associated docs) first. Updating an existing doc always takes priority over creating a new one.
3. **Be thorough** — the docs are the spec. An engineer should be able to pick up any doc and start building without follow-up questions.

## Docs Folder (`/docs`)

All research outputs, specs, and reference material live here. Keep docs focused, well-structured, and free of filler.
