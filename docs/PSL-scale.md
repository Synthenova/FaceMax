**The PSL Scale is an online facial attractiveness rating system** (roughly 0.25–8) popularized in “looksmaxxing” communities, where users assess and try to enhance their appearance through grooming, exercises, or surgery. It divides people into tiers from “subhuman” (bottom ~0.05%) to ultra-rare “Tera Chad/Stacy” (top 1 in 12 billion), with most falling into “normie” categories.  

Research suggests the system originated in fringe incel-adjacent forums in the 2010s and has gone mainstream on TikTok among teens, often as memes or self-improvement talk, though evidence leans toward it amplifying body-image pressures and unrealistic standards.  

**What It Measures**  
Ratings focus on four main aspects: harmony (how features fit together), dimorphism (masculine/feminine distinctiveness), angularity (sharpness linked to low body fat), and miscellaneous traits like skin clarity, nose shape, eyebrow thickness, and more. Moderators on forums like Looksmax.org analyze up to 46 facial measurements using spreadsheets for a precise score.  

**Common Tiers (Simplified)**  
- Subhuman (0.25–1.5): Severe deformities or extreme unattractiveness.  
- Low/Mid/High-Tier Normie (1.5–5.5): The vast majority (~93% of people); “average” to “noticeably good-looking in daily life.”  
- Chadlite/Stacylite (5.5–6): Model-adjacent, clear social advantages.  
- Chad/Stacy (6–7.25): Rare, standout beauty with easy romantic success.  
- Giga/Tera Chad/Stacy (7.25+): Near-mythical perfection.  

Real-life “sexual market value” often adds 1.5–1.75 points to account for height, status, body, etc.  

**Teen Usage and Context**  
Teens reference it in casual TikTok videos, group chats, and memes (“Is it over for me?”), blending humor with serious tracking of progress like “mewing” (tongue posture for jawline). Celebrity examples vary by source: Cristiano Ronaldo and Jake Gyllenhaal often land as high-tier normie; Angelina Jolie, Margot Robbie, or Jordan Barrett as higher tiers.  

While some view it as motivational self-care, studies from universities like Dalhousie and Portsmouth highlight risks of lowered self-esteem, exposure to misogynistic ideas, and encouragement of risky procedures among young users.

The PSL Scale represents one of the most detailed and debated attractiveness frameworks to emerge from niche online spaces and spill into mainstream teen culture. Named after the now-defunct forums PUAHate (Pick-Up Artist Hate), SlutHate, and Lookism, the acronym PSL has become shorthand for a supposedly objective way to quantify facial beauty based on proportions, symmetry, and harmony. Looksmax.org, widely seen as the spiritual successor to Lookism, hosts detailed guides and Discords where teenagers and young adults rate faces, track “ascension” progress, and share advice. A widely cited 2023 guide on the forum explains that PSL rates purely on facial aesthetics—harmony, balance, symmetry, sexual dimorphism, unique qualities, and averageness—unlike broader 1–10 “real-life” scales that factor in body, height, personality, wealth, or status.

Ratings are calculated by breaking the face into dozens of precise metrics. One 16-year-old Discord moderator named Mep described the process: evaluators score four core aspects—harmony (how features cohesively work together), dimorphism (how distinctly masculine or feminine the face appears), angularity (sharpness and definition, often tied to low body fat), and miscellaneous features (eyebrow thickness, skin clarity, nasolabial folds, color contrast, nose shape, teeth, eye spacing, canthal tilt, etc.). A full analysis might involve 46 dimensions, such as the cervicomental angle (neck-to-chin) or palpebral fissure ratio (eyelid proportions), tallied in color-coded spreadsheets out of roughly 305 points before conversion to the 0.25–8 PSL score. The scale follows a normal distribution: the bottom ~1% (0–1.5) are labeled subhuman; the middle ~92.7% (1.5–5.5) cover all normie/Becky tiers; the top 1% split into Chadlite/Stacylite and true Chad/Stacy territory.

The full tier structure, drawn directly from the influential Looksmax.org guide, appears below (rarity estimates are community-derived and approximate):

| PSL Score | Male Category          | Female Category       | Additional Remarks                                                                 | Rarity          |
|-----------|------------------------|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| 7.75–8    | Tera Chad             | Tera Stacy           | Mythical perfection; reserved for Adonis-like ideals or religious icons; virtually unattainable | 1 in 12 billion |
| 7.25–7.75 | Giga Chad             | Giga Stacy           | Elite models with minimal flaws (e.g., slight eye-spacing issues); handful exist globally | 1 in 8 million  |
| 6–7.25    | Chad                  | Stacy                | Standout in any crowd; striking features; romantic success comes easily unless severe mental-health issues | 1 in 153,000    |
| 5.5–6     | Chadlite              | Stacylite            | Model potential or large social-media following; clear life advantages from looks   | 1 in 4,500      |
| 4.5–5.5   | High-Tier Normie (HTN)| High-Tier Becky (HTB)| Among the best-looking in a classroom or small workplace; noticeably appealing      | 1 in 92         |
| 3–4.5     | Mid-Tier Normie (MTN) | Mid-Tier Becky (MTB) | Completely average; ordinary person                                                | 1 in 2          |
| 1.5–3     | Low-Tier Normie (LTN) | Low-Tier Becky (LTB) | Noticeably below average; may face mild bullying or social drawbacks               | 1 in 7          |
| 0.25–1.5  | Subhuman              | Subhuman             | Extreme unattractiveness or deformities; almost no redeeming facial qualities       | 1 in 2,000      |

To convert to a 1–10 real-life rating, users simply add ~1.5–1.75 points for non-facial factors. Celebrity placements illustrate the system’s subjectivity and Eurocentric leanings: high-tier normie examples frequently include Cristiano Ronaldo, Jake Gyllenhaal, Justin Bieber, Zendaya, Gigi Hadid, Dua Lipa, Kylie Jenner, and Timothée Chalamet; Chad/Stacy tiers feature Tom Cruise, Matt Bomer, Margot Robbie, and Angelina Jolie; Giga/Tera levels cite models like Jordan Barrett, David Gandy, Sean O’Pry, or historical figures like Jon-Erik Hexum. Lower examples sometimes reference Steve Buscemi or Michael Cera as low-tier normie.

The system’s appeal to teenagers lies in its perceived objectivity and actionable roadmap. On TikTok, short videos explain ratios (facial width-to-height, midface ratio 0.95–1.0 for men, interpupillary distance), while longer livestreams rate strangers or offer paid ratings ($100+). Teens meme about “negative canthal tilt,” “recessed maxilla,” or “is it over?” (meaning no hope without major intervention). Softmaxxing techniques include mewing (tongue against palate for jaw definition), minoxidil for eyebrows/beard, castor oil, neck exercises for dimorphism, and gym focus on delts and V-taper. Hardmaxxing escalates to buccal fat removal, jaw fillers, bimax (double-jaw) surgery, palate expanders, or even controversial “bonesmashing.” Forums emphasize starting soft and progressing methodically, with warnings that surgery carries risks and results vary.

Origins trace to the 2010s manosphere. PUAHate gained notoriety after Elliot Rodger’s 2014 Isla Vista attacks, in which he cited the forum in his manifesto; it rebranded as SlutHate amid backlash. Lookism formalized looksmaxxing as a methodology blending blackpill fatalism (looks determine destiny) with self-improvement. By 2023, researchers noted TikTok’s role in “normiefication”—spreading incel-adjacent language to wider audiences via algorithms. Today, Looksmax.org Discord moderators field requests from 13- and 14-year-olds asking about HGH doses or surgeries to “get the love they never got.”

Yet scholarly and psychological analyses paint a more cautionary picture. A Dalhousie University study (2025) of looksmaxxing forums found users subjected to harsh “hegemonic masculine gaze” critiques—“Your face looks grotesque,” body-shaming, and occasional suicide encouragement (“nothing you can do will help… complete suicide”). Participants are told their worth hinges solely on appearance, leading to demoralization and health risks from steroids, unproven supplements, or dangerous procedures. A University of Portsmouth paper on digital subcultural diffusion describes how PSL and looksmaxxing rebrand incel ideology as aspirational aesthetics, making misogynistic frameworks more palatable to Gen Z while still centering Eurocentric (often white) ideals of bone structure and dimorphism. Psychology Today (February 2026) notes the trend exploits young men’s lack of traditional body-image discussion spaces, escalating perfection pressure amid social media and rising male cosmetic spending. While some users report genuine confidence gains from grooming or fitness, the dominant evidence from peer-reviewed work indicates net harm: heightened anxiety, distorted self-perception, and normalization of lookism that devalues personality, kindness, or intellect.

In practice, rating remains subjective—forum threads routinely debate ideal jaw angles (112–123°), FWHR (1.9–2.05), or whether certain ethnic features count as “harmony.” Women’s participation is smaller and less standardized; “True Eve” debates often turn competitive. Subliminal YouTube videos promising facial changes through exposure to model images circulate, with anecdotal claims of “jaw aching” or improved features.

Ultimately, the PSL Scale offers a granular language for discussing beauty that resonates with digitally native teens, but its roots and real-world effects reveal deeper complexities. It can spark healthy habits like better skincare or exercise, yet the same framework frequently fosters obsession, comparison, and exclusionary standards. As one moderator observed, “Perfection cannot be involved since humans were never meant to be perfect… the only reason we find some faces attractive is because they have that 1-2 flaws that makes it unique.” For many young users, however, the scale’s rigid tiers overshadow nuance, turning self-improvement into a high-stakes numbers game with lasting psychological stakes.
