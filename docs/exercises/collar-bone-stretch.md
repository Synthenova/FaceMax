# Collar Bone Stretch

## Overview
- **Category**: Jawline & Neck
- **Target Areas**: Sternocleidomastoid, Platysma, Trapezius (upper), Neck extensors
- **Equipment Needed**: None

## How It Works
The collar bone stretch targets the muscles along the sides and front of the neck, including the sternocleidomastoid (the prominent muscle running diagonally from behind the ear to the collarbone). This exercise helps release tension, improve neck flexibility, and create a more elongated, defined neck appearance that enhances jawline definition. It also promotes better posture by counteracting forward head posture.

## Instructions

### Step-by-Step (All Levels)
1. **Starting position**: Sit or stand tall with spine straight, shoulders down and back
2. **Turn your head 45 degrees** to the left (looking over your shoulder)
3. **Tilt your head back slightly** to engage the front neck muscles
4. **Press your tongue to the roof of your mouth** firmly
5. **Extend your lower lip up** toward your nose as far as possible
6. **Hold for 5-10 seconds**, feeling the stretch along the collarbone area
7. **Release and repeat** on the other side

### Beginner Variation
- **Duration per session**: 5 repetitions per side
- **Frequency**: 3-4 times per week
- **Intensity**: Gentle stretch, focus on feeling the muscle engagement
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Keep head tilt minimal; don't tilt back as far
  - Hold for only 3-5 seconds per side
  - Place hand on collarbone to feel the muscle activate
  - Perform in front of a mirror to ensure proper form

### Intermediate Variation
- **Duration per session**: 8-10 repetitions per side, 2 sets
- **Frequency**: Daily or 5-6 times per week
- **Intensity**: Moderate stretch with strong muscle engagement
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Full head tilt back to engage muscles fully
  - Hold for 8-10 seconds per repetition
  - Add slight resistance by gently pressing hand against forehead
  - Rest 20 seconds between sets

### Advanced Variation
- **Duration per session**: 12-15 repetitions per side, 3 sets
- **Frequency**: Daily
- **Intensity**: Deep stretch with maximal safe muscle contraction
- **Specific modifications**:
  - Combine with neck rotation during the hold
  - Hold for 10-15 seconds with strong tongue-to-palate pressure
  - Add gentle isometric resistance with hand
  - Perform as part of a complete neck exercise circuit

## Common Mistakes
- **Over-tilting the head**: Going too far back can cause dizziness or strain
- **Not turning the head**: Failing to turn 45 degrees reduces effectiveness
- **Tongue not engaged**: Forgetting to press tongue to roof of mouth
- **Shoulders rising**: Letting shoulders creep up toward ears
- **Holding breath**: Remember to breathe normally throughout
- **Moving too fast**: The stretch should be slow and controlled
- **Uneven sides**: Make sure to do equal reps on both sides

## Expected Results
- **Timeline**:
  - Initial muscle awareness: 1-2 weeks
  - Improved neck flexibility: 2-4 weeks
  - Visible toning: 4-6 weeks
  - Noticeable neck definition: 2-3 months
- **What to expect**:
  - More flexible neck muscles
  - Reduced tension in neck and upper shoulders
  - Better posture with head aligned over spine
  - More defined collarbone area
  - Enhanced jawline appearance through improved neck contour
  - Reduced appearance of neck lines
