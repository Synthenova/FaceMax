# Bone Smashing

> **⚠️ EXTREME WARNING ⚠️**
> This technique is highly controversial, potentially dangerous, and NOT recommended by medical professionals. It is included for informational purposes only to document its existence in the looksmaxxing community. FaceMax does NOT endorse or recommend this practice.

## Overview
- **Category**: Extreme/Hardmaxxing (NOT RECOMMENDED)
- **Target Areas**: Facial bones (jaw, cheekbones, chin)
- **Equipment Needed**: Blunt objects (bottles, tools - NOT RECOMMENDED)

## What It Is
Bone smashing (also called "bone hitting" or "bone remodeling") is an extreme looksmaxxing technique that involves striking facial bones with blunt objects to cause micro-fractures, theoretically triggering bone remodeling and increased bone density in targeted areas. It has gained attention through influencers like Clavicular but is widely criticized by medical professionals.

## ⚠️ MEDICAL WARNING

**This technique is:**
- **NOT supported by scientific evidence**
- **Considered dangerous by medical professionals**
- **Banned from most looksmaxxing communities due to injury reports**
- **Potentially permanently disfiguring**

**Documented risks include:**
- Permanent facial fractures
- Nerve damage
- Infection
- Uneven bone growth/asymmetry
- Chronic pain
- Sinus damage
- Dental damage
- Scarring
- Psychological trauma from disfigurement

## The Theory (Unproven)
Proponents claim that controlled micro-trauma to bone stimulates osteoblast activity, causing:
- Increased bone density
- Bone remodeling in targeted areas
- Wider jaw or more prominent cheekbones

**Reality:** There is NO peer-reviewed scientific evidence supporting these claims in the context of facial bone smashing. Wolff's Law (bone adapts to stress) applies to gradual, physiological loads - not traumatic impact.

## Why FaceMax Includes This Entry
We document bone smashing for three reasons:
1. **Education** - Users will encounter this term in looksmaxxing communities
2. **Safety** - Understanding the risks prevents experimentation
3. **Transparency** - Acknowledging the full landscape of techniques, even harmful ones

## What Medical Professionals Say

**Orthopedic Surgeons:** Facial bones are not designed for impact trauma. Repeated striking causes:
- Stress fractures
- Compartment syndrome
- Compromised blood supply to bone
- Irregular healing patterns

**Dermatologists:** External trauma damages:
- Skin tissue
- Subcutaneous fat
- Blood vessels
- Nerves
- Connective tissue

**Neurologists:** Facial region contains:
- Multiple cranial nerves
- Delicate sinus structures
- Risk of traumatic neuropathy

## Reported Injuries from Bone Smashing
- Permanent facial asymmetry
- Chronic facial pain
- Loss of sensation
- Infection requiring hospitalization
- Fractured cheekbones
- Damaged teeth
- Scarring
- Psychological issues from disfigurement

## Safe Alternatives

### For Jawline Definition:
- **Mewing** - Proper tongue posture (proven, safe)
- **Mastic Gum** - Builds masseter muscles
- **Jawzrsize** - Device-based resistance (with caution)
- **Neck Training** - Improves jaw-to-neck ratio
- **Body Fat Reduction** - Reveals natural jawline

### For Cheekbone Prominence:
- **Buccal Massage** - Releases tension, improves contour
- **Gua Sha** - Lymphatic drainage
- **Facial Exercises** - Tone underlying muscles
- **Mewing** - May influence maxilla over time
- **Makeup/Contouring** - Immediate non-invasive results

### For Overall Facial Structure:
- **Posture Correction** - Forward head posture ruins facial aesthetics
- **Nasal Breathing** - Supports proper facial development
- **Sleep Optimization** - Prevents facial distortion
- **Hydration/Diet** - Reduces facial bloating

## Legal and Ethical Considerations

### Liability Issues
- Self-inflicted injury from following online trends
- No medical professional endorses this
- Influencers promoting this face potential legal action

### Community Standards
- Most looksmaxxing forums ban bone smashing discussion
- Reddit's r/looksmaxxing prohibits it
- YouTube removes instructional content

## If You or Someone You Know Has Tried This

**Seek immediate medical attention if you experience:**
- Severe pain
- Swelling that doesn't subside
- Numbness or tingling
- Difficulty opening mouth
- Vision changes
- Nosebleeds
- Signs of infection (redness, warmth, pus)

**Mental Health Resources:**
- Body dysmorphia is common in looksmaxxing communities
- If appearance concerns are causing distress, consider speaking with a mental health professional
- The pursuit of "perfect" facial features should never compromise physical health

## The Bottom Line

**Bone smashing is:**
❌ Dangerous
❌ Unproven
❌ Potentially permanently disfiguring
❌ Not endorsed by any medical professional
❌ Banned from responsible looksmaxxing communities

**FaceMax Position:**
We are a **softmaxxing** app focused on safe, evidence-based techniques. Bone smashing is explicitly excluded from our recommended exercises. This entry exists purely as documentation and warning.

## Safety & Disclaimers

### Risk Level: 🔴 EXTREME - NOT RECOMMENDED

### Who Should ABSOLUTELY Avoid
- EVERYONE
- Specifically: Anyone who values their health and appearance

### Documented Consequences
- Permanent facial fractures
- Nerve damage and loss of sensation
- Infection
- Asymmetry and disfigurement
- Chronic pain
- Psychological trauma
- Dental damage
- Sinus complications

### Warning Signs If You've Already Done This
- Persistent pain
- Swelling lasting more than 48 hours

- Visible deformity

### ⚠️ CRITICAL MEDICAL DISCLAIMER
> **THIS IS NOT MEDICAL ADVICE. THIS IS A WARNING.**
>
> **Bone smashing can cause permanent, disfiguring injuries. There is NO scientific evidence that it works. The risks FAR outweigh any potential benefits.**
>
> **If you are considering bone smashing:**
> - Speak with a board-certified plastic surgeon about LEGAL, SAFE alternatives
> - Consult a mental health professional about body image concerns
> - Consider that facial features are largely determined by genetics and skeletal structure
> - Remember that confidence and grooming matter more than extreme modifications
>
> **FaceMax does NOT recommend, endorse, or support bone smashing. This technique is documented here as a warning, not an instruction.**
>
> **If you have already performed bone smashing and are experiencing pain, swelling, numbness, or any concerning symptoms, SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION.**
