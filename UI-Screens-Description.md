# FaceMax - Screen Descriptions
## Plain English UI Guide for Designer

---

## Screen 1: Splash Screen

This is the first thing users see when opening the app. It shows the FaceMax logo in the center with the app name below it. A brief tagline appears underneath. At the bottom, there's a simple loading indicator that shows the app is starting up. After a couple of seconds, it automatically moves to the onboarding flow.

---

## Screen 2: Onboarding Chat

This screen looks like a messaging app conversation. The background is dark. Messages from the AI coach appear on the left side in bubbles, and user responses appear on the right. At the bottom, there's a text input field where users can type or tap a microphone button to speak their answers.

The AI asks questions one at a time like "What's your name?" and "How old are you?" For some questions, quick reply buttons appear above the keyboard so users can tap instead of type. When the AI asks for a photo, there's a camera icon users can tap to upload. When it asks for numbers like height or weight, there are scrollable number pickers that appear.

The conversation feels natural and friendly, not like filling out a form.

---

## Screen 3: AI Future Self Video

After the user uploads their photo, this screen shows a generated video of their "future self." The video plays in the center of the screen. Below the video, text explains this is what they could look like in three months. There's a large button at the bottom that says "Start My Journey" to enter the main app.

---

## Screen 4: Routine Tab (Home Screen)

This is the main screen users see when they open the app. At the top, there's a greeting like "Good morning, Alex" and below that shows how many days in a row they've completed their routine (their streak) with a small flame icon.

Below that is a big card showing today's progress with a progress bar filling up as they complete exercises. Underneath are cards for each exercise they need to do today. Each card shows a thumbnail image of the exercise, the name, how long it takes, and whether it's completed or not. Completed exercises have a checkmark. Incomplete ones have a play button.

When all exercises are done for the day, a countdown timer appears showing when the next routine is available.

---

## Screen 5: Exercise Detail Screen

When a user taps on an exercise, this screen opens. The top half shows a video demonstration of the exercise playing on loop. Below the video are step-by-step instructions explaining how to do it properly. At the bottom is a big button that says "Start Recording" which opens the camera.

---

## Screen 6: Camera Recording Screen

This is the full-screen camera view. The camera shows the user's face with a rectangular guide frame overlay so they know where to position themselves. At the top, there's a timer counting down or up depending on the exercise.

At the bottom center is a big circular record button. When pressed, it turns red and pulses to show recording is active. Sometimes tip messages appear at the bottom like "Move slightly to the left" or "Great form!" to help guide the user.

After recording stops, there's a preview of what was recorded with options to save it or retake.

---

## Screen 7: Track Tab (Progress Screen)

This screen shows the user's progress over time. At the top are four stat cards showing total exercises completed, current streak, days tracked, and points earned.

Below that is a line graph showing exercise consistency over the past week. Further down are expandable sections for measurements like face symmetry score, jawline definition, and weight tracking. Each shows the current value and whether it went up or down from last week.

At the bottom is a horizontal scroll of recent video recordings with thumbnails.

---

## Screen 8: Gallery Screen

This screen shows all the videos the user has recorded. Videos are arranged in a grid with two columns. Each thumbnail shows a preview of the video with the date and exercise name overlaid at the bottom. Tapping a video opens it in full-screen playback mode.

There are filter options at the top to see videos from specific weeks or exercise types.

---

## Screen 9: Chat Tab (AI Coach)

This is a dedicated chat screen with the AI coach. It looks similar to the onboarding chat. The AI coach has a name and avatar that appears on the left side. Users can type messages or upload photos for the AI to analyze.

Above the keyboard, there are suggestion buttons for quick questions like "Analyze my progress" or "Form check help." When the AI is thinking, there's a "typing" indicator with three dots.

---

## Screen 10: Weekly Analysis Screen

This screen appears once a week after the AI analyzes the user's progress. It shows a large overall score out of 100 with encouraging text based on how well they did.

There's a before and after comparison showing photos from the start of the week versus now. Below that are progress bars for different metrics like face symmetry, jawline definition, and cheekbone prominence. Each shows a score and whether it improved.

At the bottom is a personalized message from the AI coach summarizing the week and giving advice for the next week.

---

## Screen 11: Social Tab

This screen has three sections users can switch between using tabs at the top.

The first tab is Leaderboard, showing rankings of all users by points. The top three users are displayed on a podium graphic. Below that is a scrollable list showing everyone's rank, with the current user highlighted.

The second tab is Forum, which looks like a feed of discussion posts. Each post shows the author's profile picture, name, post title, and a preview of the content. Users can upvote posts and see how many comments there are. Tapping a post opens the full discussion with comments.

The third tab is Discover (also called Doomscroll), which shows a vertical feed of short videos about looksmaxing tips and techniques. Users swipe up to see the next video. When they've seen all new videos for the day, a message appears saying they're caught up.

---

## Screen 12: Shop Screen

This is a placeholder screen for the future shop. It shows an illustration of face tools and products. Text explains the shop is coming soon. There's an email input field where users can sign up to be notified when it launches. Below are preview images of product categories that will be available.

---

## Screen 13: Account Screen

This screen has the user's profile information at the top with their photo, name, email, and what subscription tier they're on.

Below that is a list of menu options including:
- Edit Profile
- Subscription (shows current plan with a manage button)
- Gallery (links to their recordings)
- Notifications settings
- Privacy and Security
- Help and Support
- About FaceMax

Tapping each option goes to that specific settings page.

---

## Screen 14: Paywall Screen

This screen appears when free users try to access paid features. It has an illustration at the top showing the benefits of upgrading. Below that is a comparison showing what's included in the free version versus the paid version.

There are two pricing cards showing monthly and annual options, with the annual option having a "save money" badge. At the bottom is a large button to upgrade and a smaller option to close the screen and stay on the free plan.

---

## Screen 15: Exercise Success Screen

After completing an exercise, this screen appears briefly to celebrate. It shows a checkmark animation, the points earned, and a encouraging message like "Exercise complete!" or "Great job!" There's a button to continue to the next exercise or finish for now.

---

## Screen 16: Daily Complete Screen

When all exercises for the day are finished, this screen appears with celebration graphics. It shows the total points earned that day, updates the streak counter, and has a share button if users want to share their achievement. At the bottom, it shows a countdown to when the next routine is available.

---

That's all the main screens needed for the FaceMax app.
